# Adventures in Reproducible Visualizations

This is a collection of (completely) reproducible data visualization pieces,
all of them so far produced with R and `ggplot2`. Each subdirectory contains
all of the code (and the data, when possible) you will need to reproduce the
image shown in that projects's `README.md` file. Some projects are not yet
finished, of course, and in that case your mileage may vary.

## License

This is a bit tricky. All source code is licensed under the project license
(see the `LICENSE` file in this directory). Usually, the visualizations in
their unmodified form have an embedded (CC-BY-SA) license. Raw data (which is
provided when possible) often comes with its own license terms, which are laid
out in the `README.md` files in each directory. Generally speaking, you will be
quite fine so long as you provide attribution and a copy of the original
license.
